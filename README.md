###Connor-Stevens Model Neuron

The Connor Stevens model neuron is like the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron, but with slightly different kinetics for the fast sodium and potassium delayed-rectifier channels and an additional A-type potassium channel (Dayan and Abbott, Theoretical Neuroscience, Ch. 6). These changes give the Connor Stevens neuron Type I excitability such that it can achieve arbitrarily low spike rates. This feature may make this model more useful for testing custom modules than the Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron.
